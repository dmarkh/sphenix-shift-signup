<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>General Instructions and Welcome</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">Welcome to the sPHENIX shift signup web
page. Participating in shift work is a great way to learn about the
operation and capabilities of the sPHENIX detector, and to contribute to
sPHENIX's scientific program. Your participation is greatly appreciated!</P>

<!--
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">This year most aspects of the shift
sign-up are the same as last year. Similar to last year, for the
coming run we will have two detector operators on each shift (apart
from the initial two weeks) to insure we begin taking data as quickly
as possible after a store has been established. Also similar to last
year the overlap day will be on Tuesday. In the interest of
efficiency in data taking, this year we will again be very rigorous
about requiring both shift crews to be present for the full overlap
period. So please plan to accommodate the fact that a shift week is a
commitment for a full 8 days (1 week plus 1 full overlap day).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The new signup sheet has been designed
to automatically provide helpful information, and to recognize what
positions you are qualified to sign up for. Once you have selected a
signup sheet for viewing, click on any button along the border at the
top of the signup to get a description of the responsibilities and
training requirements for that shift position. If a circle appears in
the box in the column under that shift position, you are eligible to
sign up; just click on it.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">One special case is the signup slots
for the positions of Shift Leader and Detector Operator. Anticipating
that people will want to train for these positions and then serve in
one or both capacities later in the run, a person may sign up in one
of these boxes even if they are not yet certified, PROVIDED they have
also signed up in a training slot for this position at a date prior
to that they intend to serve as Shift Leader or Detector Operator.
Training for these positions several weeks before the time you wish
to serve in them is highly preferable, but not required.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in; font-weight: bold;">
Furthermore, a person is not supposed to train as Shift Leader or Detector
 Operator in a given year and not take an actual shift as Shift Leader or
 Detector Operator later that same year.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The procedure for certification of
Shift Leaders and Detector Operators will be the same as last year:
once a candidate has trained under a certified Shift Leader or
Detector Operator for a period of a week, an assessment of the
candidate's readiness will be solicited by the Quality Assurance
Board which will consider certification of the candidate. These are
the only two shift positions that require formal certification.
Period Coordinators are appointed by the Spokesperson based on their
experience with the operation of the sPHENIX detector and their ability
to carry forward the near-term goals of the sPHENIX scientific program
during data taking. If you would like to serve as a period
coordinator, please let us know.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">
Beginning in run 16, following recommendation #4 of the APS Site Visit
Committee, we have been assigning first priority for offline QA shifts to
collaborators with travel constraints due to family obligations.  If you request
pre-assigned offline QA shifts under this policy, please communicate these
requests to Rosi Reed <A HREF="mailto:rosijreed@lehigh.edu">rosijreed@lehigh.edu</A> well ahead of the
time of first opening of the shift sign-up.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">You have the ability to un-assign yourself once you
have signed up for a shift. The sign-up remains flexible. Once you
have signed up, you may un-assign yourself later on. However, once
you are within 3 weeks of the time when you are scheduled to serve a
shift, the signup will lock in your home institution as the
institution responsible for covering that shift. If you un-assign
yourself after this date, you and your institutional representative
will both receive an automatic email notification. It will indicate
that this slot has now been vacated, and that your institution is
responsible for finding a replacement with equivalent training.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">The rest should be pretty
self-explanatory. If you have questions, please contact Rosi Reed
(<A HREF="mailto:rosijreed@lehigh.edu">rosijreed@lehigh.edu</A>). Thanks
once again for your participation in this important and interesting
aspect of sPHENIX's program!

The individual, appointed and reporting to the sPHENIX Spokesperson Office for a certain period during a RHIC run, 
has responsibility for oversight and continuity of the sPHENIX experimental scientific program on day-to-day, 
week-to-week basis. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in"><A NAME="pc1"></A>
Once the sPHENIX detector has been commissioned and brought into "routine" operation for data taking, 
the Period Coordinator is responsible for calling and leading meetings required for the coordination of regular shift crew in carrying out the near term scientific program. The period coordinator should contact each shift once a day at least to ensure that the information flow between shifts is correct. He/she is expected to attend weekly trigger-board meetings to be updated on any decision/change on the near-term run program, to attend fast-offline QA meetings to coordinate with offline on calibration requests, to chair daily sPHENIX operation meetings, and to attend the regular CAD operation meetings, weekly scheduling meetings and machine/experiment coordination meetings to understand and convey CAD plans to sPHENIX operation and shift team, to give a regular presentation of sPHENIX run progress and updates at the weekly CAD time meeting. The period coordinator will be in close contact with the sPHENIX operation management team on issues related to the detector subsystems, shifts, operation procedure and CAD schedule/plan. 
Should a serious technical problem arise, which cannot be fixed simply by members of the shift crew in consultation with Detector Experts, 
the sPHENIX Operations Coordinator will assume responsibility for coordinating the effort by Detector Experts to bring the detector back into normal operation. 
Once the normal operation is restored, the Period Coordinator will resume responsibility for oversight and coordination of Shift Leaders and Shift crew to take sPHENIX data.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">
The Period Coordinator is not on shift during his/her tour, but he/she will be available, on 24-hour call, for consultation with the sPHENIX Shift Leaders concerning ongoing data taking priorities and pursuit of the sPHENIX scientific program. The Period Coordinator is from a member institution of the sPHENIX Collaboration. He/She has a good knowledge of the near term goals of the sPHENIX scientific program, as well as a working understanding of the configuration and operation of sPHENIX detectors systems (in particular the impact of various trigger configurations) in order to consult effectively on near term strategies for the effective pursuit of sPHENIX's scientific goals.  A period of two consecutive weeks for serving as a Period Coordinator is highly preferred but not required.

A sPHENIX Shift Leader directs the running of the sPHENIX experiment during
a shift of approximately 8 hours, once a day, for a minimum period of
eight days. He/she is the only person recognized by the
Collider-Accelerator Department as being part of the C-AD Conduct of
Operations. He/she is responsible to the Chairman of C-AD, through
the C-AD Operations Coordinator, for insuring safe operation of the
sPHENIX Detector during normal data taking activities, fully within the

The Shift Leader guides the Shift Crew, maintains liaison with the
RHIC Main Control Room and contacts the subsystem experts if problems
arise in the course of sPHENIX operations. The goal of his/her
leadership and direction is to achieve the near term scientific goals
of the sPHENIX program during an 8 hour period. A Shift Leader has final
authority on the minute to minute conduct of sPHENIX data taking
activities in the sPHENIX Control room, with one exception. With regard
to the issue of &quot;turning on&quot; or energizing sPHENIX detector
components, the Shift Leader and the <A HREF="#do"><B>Detector
Operator</B></A> both play a role. The decision to turn on a detector
requires the agreement of both the Detector Operator and the Shift
Leader. Either person can decide to turn a detector system off if
they feel continued operation would result in an unsafe condition for
the detector subsystem.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in; margin-right: 0.5in">An important
aspect of this responsibility is to insure that at the end of each
run, an entry is made in the run log by someone on shift to indicate

A sPHENIX Detector Operator is responsible for insuring all sPHENIX
detectors are operated in accordance with their safe operational
envelope. He/she is responsible for monitoring slow controls
information regarding detector performance, and for taking
appropriate action to turn detectors on and off when called for by
the condition of the accelerator or of the beams during the course of
an 8 hour shift. He/she is responsible for having a detailed
knowledge of the safe operational envelope of all sPHENIX detectors, and
is recognized as a resource and an authority in this area. With
regard to the issue of &quot;turning on&quot; or energizing sPHENIX
detector components, the Shift Leader and the Detector Operator both
play a role. The decision to turn on a detector requires the
agreement of both the Detector Operator and the Shift Leader. If
either person believes the detector should remain off for the safety
of the subsystem, the detector system will continue to remain in a
state in which it is not energized. Either person can decide to turn
a detector system off if they feel continued operation would result
in an unsafe condition for the detector subsystem.</P>

The responsibilities of the Shift Crew include participating in
general data taking activities, and assisting the Shift Leader and
Detector Operator as required. A specific responsibility is updating
the sPHENIX check list and helping to monitor the run time indicators
for all systems to help insure quality operation of the detector
during data taking activities. This includes monitoring the OnlineQA
plots which are accumulated online and proactively analyzing and
examining in real time (or as close to it as possible) a small sample
of the data being taken using a standard program incorporating the
full sPHENIX software chain operating as part of fast-offline QA. The
intent is to monitor key reconstructed physics observables which
indicate the quality of the data being taken. Possible examples
include the width of reconstructed mass peaks, reconstructed vertex
distributions, multiplicity distributions, scaler ratios versus time,
etc. These indicators will be monitored for stability for a given
running configuration, and to assess the stability of DAQ1000 data
versus data taken periodically with fully written cluster
information.</P>

In addition to personnel present at the sPHENIX detector site during
data taking an additional person will be on duty for 1 shift per day
(day shift) to review the output of offline quality assurance
production. The purpose of this effort is to provide quality
assurance evaluation of sPHENIX data production for both &quot;real
time&quot; data from the ongoing experiment run (fast-offline QA) and
for final DST production of data acquired during previous runs or
much earlier in the present run (real data production QA).

The person on this shift will be responsible for regular completion
of a number of web based tasks. In addition, they will be responsible
for reviewing the reports of the Quality Assurance Monitor and Real
Time Assistant (e.g. in the run log) to establish a list of quality
runs thought to be without problem as sequential progress is made
through the data archive. At the end of the run, one result of this
effort will be a comprehensive list based on the individual reports
of all the Offline Quality Assurance Monitor of those runs which
should (and those which should not) be included in a production run
for data analysis. Once DST production is running at full capacity
the offline QA shift will be very demanding and will probably require
the full 8 hours to complete. &nbsp;</P>

Personnel who take responsibility for offline QA shifts are not
required to be present in the counting house. However, they are
required to be on site at BNL for their first week of Offline QA
shift service. Subsequent offline QA shifts may be done from non-BNL
sites provided adequate web access to the Auto QA system can be
demonstrated from the remote site.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in"><A NAME="oqa4"></A>Presence at the BNL
site initially is motivated by the fact that many unforeseen problems
with the quality assurance/production effort will very likely arise
during these shifts and quick, real time help, which is more likely
to be available at BNL, is essential to insure daily shift
productivity.
